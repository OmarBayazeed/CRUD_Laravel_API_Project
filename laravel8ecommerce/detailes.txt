1_ i used a made template and put it in the 'template' folder;


2_ i used livewire in this project;


3_ i used jetstream:  Jetstream provides the implementation for your application's login, registration, email verification, two-factor authentication, session management, API via Laravel Sanctum, and optional team management features. Jetstream is designed using Tailwind CSS and offers your choice of Livewire or Inertia scaffolding

so i did't use breeze or laravel/ui


4_ i used Gloudemans Shoppingcart for cart


5_ i used Cartalyst Stripe for checkout
