This is my Laravel API project, It was a great way to practice my skills. In a nutshell, a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project involves building endpoints that allow me to perform these basic operations on a database. Here’s a brief description:

Create:  create new records (e.g., adding a new users, posts) by sending data to an API endpoint. The API then inserts this data into the database.
Read: retrieve existing records from the database. For example, i have an endpoint to fetch a list of users or specific details about a single user and like that for the posts.
Update: When i need to modify existing data, i send an update request to the API. This could involve changing a user’s email address, updating product details, etc.
Delete: To remove data, i send a delete request to the API. For instance, deleting a user account or removing a post from the database.
my project includes routes (endpoints) for each of these actions, and i’ve implemented the necessary logic in my Laravel controllers. Additionally, i have defined Eloquent models to interact with the database tables.
